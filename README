TruthFinder.org Website

    The goal of truthfinder.org is to provide a platform where all sides of any
    debate can be fully fleshed out in an organized manner, so that any person
    seeking the truth can get an objective view.

Setting up a development environment:

    * Create localsettings.py to override any settings.py values you want.
    * Make sure environment variable SERVER_SOFTWARE is set to "Development/0.0"
    * Create a "Home Page" node and set HOME_PAGE_ID to the node ID in your
      local settings. 
    * Same for FLAG_ID and ORPHAN_ID
    * Manually add users who have edit privileges to the User table
